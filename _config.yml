  Java 백엔드 엔지니어로서의 삶을 준비하고 있는 길근오라고 합니다. 서울대학교 우주항공공학부 학부/대학원(비행역학제어 연구실. 석사)을 졸업하였고 그 후 전문연구요원을 웹개발 회사에서 진행하면서 백엔드 엔지니어에 대한 흥미가 생겨 직무를 전환하게 되었습니다.
  
  해당 회사에서 웹 개발프로젝트를 진행하며 <mark>AWS</mark>(S3, Lambda, ECR, EC2, RDS 등)를 이용한 서비스를 운영하였고 python을 이용한 웹개발을 수행하며, <mark>Django</mark>, <mark>Flask</mark> 프레임워크를 이용하였고
  
  배포에는 <mark>Docker</mark> 를 이용하여 <mark>Linux</mark> 서버에 배포하였습니다.

  이후, **프로그래머스 클라우드 기반 백엔드 엔지니어링 데브코스**를 들으며, 소프트웨어 엔지니어가 되기 위한 기초를 갈고 닦고 있습니다.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
